<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Flowers of Mountain and Plain&rdquo; is intended primarily for travelers
and flower lovers who wish a short cut to recognizing flowers seen
on excursions or from car windows. It may also serve as a souvenir
of pleasant summer days or vacation trips. The book consists of the
twenty-five color plates to be found in &ldquo;Rocky Mountain Flowers&rdquo;
(Clements and Clements, 1914), representing one hundred and seventy-five
of the most beautiful and striking flowers of the mountains
and plains of the West. If it succeeds in opening the eyes of the
passer-by to an appreciation of the flowers by the way, or in further
stimulating an already awakened interest, it will have served its purpose.

<h2 id="c2">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
<p>Opportunity has been taken of the demand for a second edition of
&ldquo;Flowers of Mountain and Plain&rdquo; to add a simple text to the plates.
It is hoped that this will increase the interest in the flowers of the
region and help create a sentiment in favor of their preservation.

<p class="center"><a href="#pl_1">Plate 1</a>, fig. 1</p>
<p>The flowers of the Monkshood are usually deep purple-blue, but
yellowish white ones are often found. The tall plants, 4-8 ft. high,
grow in mountain meadows and along streams at 6000-12000 ft., and
bloom from early July to late August. The Aconite disguises its relation
to the buttercups by having irregular sepals, developed by insect
visitors in search of nectar. The two nectaries are underneath and at
the base of the cowl-shaped upper sepal which gives the plant its name.
In seeking nectar, the bees crawl over the group of stamens and stigmas
and in so doing either collect or deposit the pollen which clings to
their legs and abdomens. The Monkshood is frequently cultivated in
gardens and some of the species furnish a powerful drug, aconite, used
in medicine. All are poisonous and often produce fatal results among
stock when feed is scarce.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc"><a id="sp_BlueColumbine">Blue Columbine</a></span><span class="hst"> <span class="sc">Aquilegia coerulea</span></span></h3>
<p class="center"><a href="#pl_1">Plate 1</a>, fig. 2</p>
<p>This Columbine varies in color through several shades of blue and
may rarely be white. It is the state flower of Colorado, growing in
spruce and aspen woods, or in mountain meadows at 6500-12000 ft. It
is usually 2-3 ft. high and blossoms from early summer to midsummer.
Like the Monkshood and Larkspur, the columbines also belong to the
group of irregular buttercups. The nectar is contained in the swollen
tips of the petals. Pollination is effected by long-nosed bees which
cling to the petals while inserting the proboscis up the spur and at the
same time touch the group of pendant stamens with the underside of
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the body. Short-nosed bees are unable to get at the nectar in this way
and steal the honey by biting holes in the tips of the spurs. The
columbines make beautiful garden plants and the Blue Columbine as
well as one or two other native species is cultivated. The ordinary
columbine of the garden, however, belongs to the European <i>Aquilegia
vulgaris</i>. The name &ldquo;Aquilegia&rdquo; is derived from the Latin &ldquo;aquila,&rdquo;
eagle, and probably refers to the resemblance of the spurred petals to
eagles&rsquo; talons.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc"><a id="sp_RedColumbine">Red Columbine</a></span><span class="hst"> <span class="sc">Aquilegia canadensis</span></span></h3>
<p class="center"><a href="#pl_1">Plate 1</a>, fig. 3</p>
<p>The blossoms of this plant are bright red, usually more or less
tinged with yellow. It is 1-2 ft. tall, grows on wooded mountain-sides
at 7500-11000 ft. and blooms in July and August. The mountain form
has smaller, more brightly colored flowers than the eastern plant.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc"><a id="sp_BlueLarkspur">Blue Larkspur</a></span><span class="hst"> <span class="sc">Delphinium scopulorum</span></span></h3>
<p class="center"><a href="#pl_1">Plate 1</a>, fig. 4</p>
<p>The Larkspur, like the Monkshood, has developed oddly shaped
sepals, but the upper one, instead of resembling a cowl, is more like
the spur of a bird. The common name refers to this resemblance.
The plants grow as tall as 6-8 ft. and are found on foothills and mountain-sides
at 5000-10000 ft. They bloom in midsummer and the flowers
vary from pale blue to deep purple-blue. The Blue Larkspur, like
many other species of larkspur, is poisonous to stock.</p>

<p>This Anemone is usually white, but it varies through pink to deep
rose-red. It is 1-2 ft. tall, grows in meadows and on hillsides at
7000-12000 ft. and blooms throughout the summer. Most anemones

have an acrid juice which irritates the skin and is poisonous if taken
internally. They make very attractive garden plants, though the native
species are little cultivated as yet.</p>

<p>The Alpine Clematis differs from the cultivated species in climbing
but rarely. The plants are usually but a few inches high and bear very
ornamental lavender or purple-blue flowers. Under favorable conditions
they may clamber over shrubs for a few feet. They are found in
open forest and woodland at 7000-10000 ft. The flowers open in spring
and early summer and are visited by insects for the plentiful pollen,
though they contain no honey. Like the cultivated species, the seed-like
fruits have long feathery styles which form silvery clusters.</p>

<p>The Alpine Buttercup has bright yellow, cup-like flowers that fit
our ideas of a buttercup much better than do those of the Trailing
Buttercup described below. It is more rarely found, since it grows
only on alpine peaks at 10000-14000 ft. It prefers wet places among
the rocks and near snow-banks and blooms in midsummer. Many
species of buttercup possess a more or less acrid juice. For this
reason, they are little eaten by cattle and hence the notion that the
deep color of butter in early spring is due to the buttercup is, of course,
without foundation.</p>

<p>The Pasque Flower is one of the earliest spring blossoms, as is indicated
by the name which is from the French for Easter. The word
&ldquo;Pulsatilla&rdquo; means wind flower and indicates its relationship to the
anemones. The color of the flower ranges from whitish through pale
blue or pink to purple. By the end of spring, the flowers have all
developed into beautiful feathery clusters of fruits, very like those of
the Clematis. The plants are 6-15 in. high and densely covered with
fuzzy white hairs. They occur abundantly on plains and foothills
and in mountain meadows at 4000-10000 ft. The Pasque Flower is
the state flower of South Dakota and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<p>Water lilies are not lilies at all but are very like buttercups in the
structure of the flower. The famous Lotus Flower of the Nile is a
water lily. The flowers of the Rocky Mountain species are yellow,
tinged with red. They may be found from May to August, floating
on the surface of lakes and slow streams up to 11000 ft. The seeds
from the large mucilaginous pods are used as food by the Indians of
the Northwest. They are dried and roasted, after which they taste
very much like popcorn, or they may be ground into meal and made
into porridge or bread. Nymphaea means &ldquo;water nymph&rdquo; and refers
to the home of the plant.</p>

<p>The plants of the Yellow Violet are low and the deep-green leaves
often form carpet-like masses along the moist edges of brook-banks

<p>The flowers of the Prairie Violet are large and deep blue, though
albino forms are sometimes found. The plants are stemless and only a
few inches high, blooming on prairies at 3000-6000 ft. from April to
June. The Prairie Violet may easily be mistaken for the Bird&rsquo;s-foot

clumps or thickets in which the plants may be 6-10 ft. high. The
flowers occur in large rose-purple, pink or rarely white clusters which
are found throughout the summer. They contain much nectar and consequently
are great favorites among the bees. This plant is a relative

<p>This plant belongs to the same family as the familiar Bleeding
Heart and Dutchman&rsquo;s Breeches, but the flower is yellow in color and
has only one spur. It is especially fond of open, sandy or gravelly soils
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
and is found widely distributed in woodlands and on hillsides at 4000-10000
ft. The plants begin flowering in June and continue throughout
the summer. They vary greatly in size from tiny individuals an inch

<p>The delicate blue flowers of the Flax open soon after sunrise, and
the petals drop late in the morning, so that the plant is hardly noticeable
for the rest of the day. The plants are found on the plains and
in the foothills at 5000-10000 ft. and bloom all summer. The Blue
Flax is grown in gardens for ornamental purposes and is cultivated
by the Indians for the sake of its remarkably strong fibres. The
Klamath Indians make these into string and cords which are then
used in baskets and mats, fish nets, the meshes of snow-shoes, etc.
General cultivation of this native species has not proven profitable,
however, since the common flax excels it both in fibre and in seeds,
and is commercially one of our most useful plants.</p>

summer in woods, fallow fields and along roadsides at 4000-8000 ft.
The leaflets fold together and &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; at night, as the clovers do. Both
the common and the botanical names refer to the sour juice of the
stems and leaves, and it is this quality that causes the Violet Wood

<p class="center"><a href="#pl_7">Plate 7</a>, fig. 4</p>
<p>The beauty of the Snow-on-the-Mountain is due to the white border
of the leaves and bracts, and not at all to the flowers, which are
reduced to tiny stamens and pistils. A field of these plants with their
snowy foliage makes clear the reason for the common name. They
may be found all summer in abundance in the clay soil of pastures
and roadsides at 4000-7000 ft., but should be handled with care since
the milky juice is poisonous. Where it touches the skin, it often causes
itching and inflammation, accompanied with pimples and blisters very
like those caused by poison ivy. This blistering action is so decided
that the juice is said to be used to brand cattle in some parts of the
West, as the scar heals more rapidly than one made by the branding
iron. Honey made from the flowers is also poisonous, but since it is
hot and disagreeable to the taste, it is not apt to be eaten.</p>
<p>Snow-on-the-Mountain has considerable value as an ornamental
plant for the garden, and it furnishes some rubber, though not in sufficient
quantity to be commercially important. Other species of <i>Euphorbia</i>,
or spurge, were formerly used as cathartics and stimulants, but
they are all too acrid for safe application, either externally or internally.
The small species are sometimes used to cauterize warts, but other
means are more certain in their effect and less likely to cause injury
to the surrounding skin.</p>

<p>The fruit of the Storksbill bears a fancied resemblance to the long

refer to this resemblance. The flowers are rose-purple and look like
those of a small geranium. The twisted fruits have been carried everywhere

<p>The Geranium, like the Alfilaria, has a fruit resembling the long

The latter, however, grows usually along brook-banks and in wet

<p>The brilliant red color of the Indian Paintbrush is furnished mainly
by the upper leaves. The corollas are enfolded in the brightly colored
bracts, which, clustered together at the end of the stem, give the effect
of a gorgeous blossom. The plants are partial parasites and obtain
their food ready-made from their neighbors. They grow 1-3 ft. tall
and occur in foothills, mountains and forests at 6000-11000 ft. The

<p>The flowers of this Lousewort are yellowish and occur in crowded
heads on low spreading stems, 4-6 in. high. They occur in mountain
meadows at 6000-9000 ft. and bloom in spring and early summer. The
name Lousewort is derived from the Latin one which was bestowed
upon it, because once upon a time farmers believed that when their
flocks fed upon the flowers the sheep were liable to be attacked by
certain tiny lice or &ldquo;pediculi.&rdquo; The name Turtle Head is from a
fancied resemblance of the flower to the protruded head of a turtle.
The plants are supposed to be poisonous to sheep.</p>

<p>The flowers of Butter-and-Eggs are yellow and orange, and the
common name refers to these two shades of yellow. They bloom
throughout the summer and fall and are common in waste places and
fields at 3000-7000 ft. The plants are persistent deep-rooted perennial
weeds, 8-20 in. tall, and may be eradicated whenever desired by short
rotation of crops and thorough cultivation in spring and fall. They
are regarded with suspicion as being poisonous and the juice mingled
with milk constitutes a fly poison. At one time, however, the plants

thriftily at 5000-6000 ft. Alfalfa forms a most nourishing fodder for
horses and cattle and has been cultivated for ages in Southern Europe.
When sown in deep, rich soils, few plants yield so heavy a crop.
During the World War, meal was made from the dried and ground
plants and used as a substitute for flour.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Alpine Clover have a cream-white standard and
rose-purple wings and keel. They are clustered in heads on stemless
plants which form mats or cushions 4-20 in. across and grow only
on alpine peaks at 12000-14000 ft. They bloom in midsummer. The
name &ldquo;Clover&rdquo; comes from the Latin word meaning &ldquo;club&rdquo; and refers
to the resemblance between the leaf and the 3-headed club of Hercules.
The clubs of playing-cards are also no doubt an imitation of the cloverleaf.
The 3-parted leaves of the clovers fold together and &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; at
night. The cultivated clovers are valuable as fodder and the white-flowered
species makes beautiful lawns.</p>

<p>The Fireweed, as the name indicates, is found on burnt areas especially,
though it also occurs in meadows and open woods and copses.
The flowers are pale pink to deep rose-purple and bloom all summer
long. The plants are widely distributed over the continent up to
10000 ft. and grow as tall as 5 ft. The name &ldquo;Willow Herb&rdquo; is sometimes
given on account of the resemblance of the leaves to those of
the willow. The Fireweed is cultivated as an ornamental plant in
England, where the leaves are also used as an adulterant of tea. The
foliage forms a wholesome vegetable when boiled, and the young
shoots or suckers make a good substitute for asparagus. Beer and
vinegar are made in Kamchatka by fermenting the shoots and pith.
The down on the seeds resembles cotton, but possesses little tenacity,
and the fibres are too brittle and short to be of any value except in
the adulteration of other material.</p>

<p>The Goatsbeard or Salsify bears large purple flower-heads with yellow
centers at the tips of stiff, straight stems, 2-4 ft. tall. The plants
have escaped from cultivation and may be found blooming all summer,
along roadsides and in meadows at 4000-7000 ft. The roots of
the Salsify are edible and are marketed under the name of &ldquo;Oyster
Plant.&rdquo; The name &ldquo;Goatsbeard&rdquo; refer to the clusters of stiff hairy

<p>The Rose Thistle is so named on account of the bright rose-purple
flower-heads, which bloom in summer and autumn. The plants are
2-5 ft. tall and grow on plains, prairies and foothills at 5000-7000
ft. The gray-green foliage is very spiny, but when bruised to destroy
the spines forms good food for cattle. Donkeys eat the plants, spines
and all, and seem to relish them. The Thistle is the badge of
Scotland.</p>

<p>The flower clusters of the goldenrods vary from rather slender,
stiff spikes, which give the name to the group, to large, spreading,
feathery panicles. The Prairie Goldenrod belongs to the latter class
and is only medium-sized, both as to flower-clusters and plants, which
are 8 in.-2 ft. tall. It blooms from midsummer to autumn and is most
at home on the prairies, though it also occurs in meadows and on
gravel-slides at 3000-10000 ft. The Goldenrod is the state flower of
Nebraska. The botanical name for the genus comes from the Greek
&ldquo;to make whole&rdquo; which refers to the healing properties formerly attributed
to the plant.</p>

<p>The soft fuzzy balls that give this plant its name are the pistillate or
seed-bearing flowers, while the staminate or pollen-bearing ones grow
in heads on other stems. The botanical name for the genus refers to
the fact that the protruded brown anthers of the staminate heads
sometimes resemble the antennae of insects. The heads are creamy
white with rose-colored bracts enclosing them at the base, and bloom
in spring and early summer. The plants are 2-15 in. tall and grow on
prairies and in meadows and aspen woodland at 3000-10000 ft. The
leaves are gray from the white woolly hairs covering them, and grow
in clusters at the base of the flowering stems. These clusters usually
form dense mats, the leaves of which are sometimes chewed by children
as Indian Tobacco or Ladies&rsquo; Tobacco.</p>

<p>One scarcely needs an introduction to the cheery Sunflower which
overruns roadsides and fallow fields everywhere at 3000-8000 ft. The
plants are 2-5 ft. tall and bear flowers all summer. This species is
the western form of the common sunflower, <i>Helianthus annuus</i>. The
latter was held in high veneration by the ancient Peruvians and Mexicans,
being used by them as a sacred and artistic emblem. It also figures
in Greek mythology. The farmer of today, however, regards it
quite otherwise when it invades his cultivated fields. It is, nevertheless,
the state flower of Kansas. The name Sunflower was given this
plant under the impression that the heads turn their faces always
towards the sun and follow it in its daily course. This is not the case,
however, for though the heads of a field of sunflowers are usually
turned in the same direction, this is due to the effect of the prevailing
wind rather than to sunlight.</p>
<p>The common sunflower is cultivated for the sake of the honey and
wax which are obtained from the flowers by the bees, and also for its
seeds which are used in various ways. They furnish feed for domestic
and farm animals, or are ground and made into cakes, or roasted and
used as coffee. In Russia they are sold in the streets and eaten as
nuts. An oil also is obtained from them that is said to be equal to
olive oil.</p>

at the tips of stiff stems, 2-4 ft. tall. They come into bloom in early
summer and midsummer, and are found in bogs and along brook-banks
at 7000-11000 ft. The Red Lily is very like the Tiger Lily of the
garden and should be given a place there also, though it is not as yet
widely cultivated.</p>

<p>The cream-colored blossoms of the Wand Lily are grouped in open
spikes on straight slender stems 4 in.-2-1/2 ft. tall. They bloom in midsummer
in meadows and spruce and aspen woods at 7000-12000 ft.
The Wand Lily is related to the poisonous Death Camas, and is probably
poisonous also.</p>

<p>This Mariposa Lily is usually white, though delicate lilac blossoms
are sometimes found. The petals are ornamented with various markings
which give point to the common name of the genus which means
&ldquo;butterfly.&rdquo; The plants grow 1-4 ft. tall in foothills, meadows and
aspen forests at 4000-11000 ft. and bear flowers all summer long. The
genus is widely distributed and contains many beautiful species and
varieties of striking colors, which should be more generally cultivated.</p>

<p>The pink or blue-purple flowers of the Spider Lily open in the
morning and wither soon afterwards. They are grouped in open clusters
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
on stiff stems with long, grass-like leaves, and bloom from spring
to midsummer. The plants grow in clumps, 1-5 ft. tall, on prairies and
foot-hills at 3000-7000 ft. The common name refers to the cobwebby
hairs on the stamens. The Spider Lily should certainly be cultivated
in home gardens.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#pl_43">Plate 43</a>, fig. 1</p>
<p>The Blue-eyed Grass is not a grass at all, but is so called on account
of the grass-like leaves. The blue-purple, starry blossoms grow
in loose clusters on stiff stems, and bloom from spring to midsummer.
They remain open but a few hours in the morning withering as the
day advances. The plants are 6-18 in. tall and are found on prairies,
and foothills and in mountain meadows at 3000-10000 ft.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc"><a id="sp_IrisBlueFlag">Iris, Blue Flag</a></span><span class="hst"> <span class="sc">Iris missouriensis</span></span></h3>
<p class="center"><a href="#pl_43">Plate 43</a>, fig. 5</p>
<p>The large, pale blue to purple blossoms of the Iris bloom in spring
and summer, on brook-banks and in meadows at 3000-10000 ft. The
plants grow in masses, 1-3 ft. tall, and sometimes carpet the floor of a
mountain meadow. The botanical name for the Blue Flag is from the
Greek for &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; and refers to the many colors of the different
species and varieties. These are cultivated and furnish some of our
most beautiful garden plants. The earliest illustration of the Iris was
made about the beginning of the sixth century A.D. in a work by Dioscorides.
In this work, it was considered valuable as a source of drugs
rather than as a garden plant, and the number of ailments for which
iris preparations were prescribed is truly astonishing. At present,
however, its medicinal value consists merely of an extract from the
root, which is used as an emetic and cathartic. The seeds of some
species are sometimes roasted and used in Great Britain as a substitute
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
for coffee. The orris root of commerce is supplied by Iris florentina
which has a fragrant root. The Iris is the Fleur-de-lis of France,
which was for long the royal emblem.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#pl_43">Plate 43</a>, fig. 2</p>
<p>The Coral Root receives its name from the white branching roots
that resemble coral. The plant is a saprophyte, that is, it gets its food
ready-made from decaying matter, and this accounts for the lack of
green foliage. The plants are entirely reddish-purple, though the
flower-petals are white with purple dots. They grow 6 in.-1 ft. tall, in
spruce and fir woods at 7000-10000 ft. and bloom all summer.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#pl_43">Plate 43</a>, fig. 3</p>
<p>The botanical name for the Ladies&rsquo; Slipper comes from the Greek
for &ldquo;sock&rdquo; or &ldquo;buskin,&rdquo; so that the fanciful resemblance of the flower
to dainty footwear is indicated by both names. Though the sack-like
lower petal of Yellow Ladies&rsquo; Slipper is a bright yellow, the other two
petals and the sepals are yellow-green with reddish markings. The
flowers occur singly on stems 8-20 in. tall, and bloom in early summer.
They are found in meadows and aspen woodlands at 6000-9000 ft.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#pl_43">Plate 43</a>, fig. 4</p>
<p>The Rattlesnake Plantain receives this name because of its peculiarly
mottled leaves which resemble those of a plantain in shape, but
which have markings very like those of a snake. The tiny white blossoms
occur in crowded spikes on stems 2-8 in. tall and bloom in
midsummer. The plants grow in fir and spruce woods at 9000-10000
ft.</p>

<p>The fairy-like rose-purple blossoms of Calypso appear in early
spring. They occur singly on stems 4-8 in. tall, in fir and spruce woods
at 7000-10000 ft. The name &ldquo;Calypso&rdquo; is that of a nymph of Grecian
legend, and seems well fitted to this dainty plant.</p>
